git version control - system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so specific versions can be recalled later.

local version control - copying files into another directory. easy to make mistakes in e.g., writing to the wrong files, copying files that wasn't intended. solo-developer only.

centralised version control system - an evolution from local version control to deal with the need to collaborate with other developers on the same codebase. A single server contains all the versioned files, and clients check out files from that server. A serious flaw of this design is the SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE, if that server is destroyed, all the data is lost (besides snapshots that some users may have on their local machines.)

distributed version control - clients fully mirror the repository and not just a snapshot. The mirror will contain the full history of the repository. This allows repositories to be copied back to a server if that server dies losing all repository data somehow. In essence every clone is a full back up.
